// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

1. Input the number (let's call it "num").
2. Calculate the remainder when dividing "num" by 2 (i.e., "remainder = num % 2").
3. If "remainder" is equal to 0, then:
    - Output "num is even."
4. Otherwise:
    - Output "num is odd."


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

1. Initialize variables:
   - sum = 0
   - smallest = largest = read_number()  // Read the first number

2. Repeat the following steps 4 more times:
   a) Read a number (let's call it "num")
   b) Add "num" to "sum"
   c) If "num" is smaller than "smallest", update "smallest" with "num"
   d) If "num" is larger than "largest", update "largest" with "num"

3. Calculate the average:
   - average = sum / 5

4. Print the results:
   - Print "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
   - Print "The smallest number is: " + smallest
   - Print "The largest number is: " + largest
