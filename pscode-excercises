// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1)	Pick a natural number (positive whole number)
2)	Divide that number by 2
3)	If the remainder is a natural number (not a fraction) the number is even
4)	If the remainder is not a natural number (a fraction) the remainder is odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1)	Input 5 separate numbers.
2)	Calculates the average by summing up the numbers and dividing by 5.
3)	Find the smallest and largest numbers using min() and max() functions.
4)	Finally, it displays the average, smallest, and largest numbers.
    a)	Write solution to line 2 (The first calculation provides the average number)
    b)	Write solution to line 3 min() function (The second calculation provides the smallest number)
    c)	Write solution to line 3 max() function (The third calculation provides the largest number)
